This project is implemented on a raspberry pi. Dataset was really small because appending large numpy arrays each time when i press keys would take so much time. 
In order to expand dataset, first thing that i did was simply recording a video, then pretending to drive the car like it is real-time using this video record. 
That was not the best way and not accurate but it worked somehow. Later, i found another way to overcome this problem.
