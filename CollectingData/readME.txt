Dataset was really small because appending large numpy arrays each time when i press the keys would take so much time. Pressing keys, sending the image data over ROS, sending commands to the motors all of these operations would make collecting data impossible.
In order to expand dataset, first thing that i did was simply recording a video on the raspberry, then pretending to drive the car like it is real-time using this video record on the pc. 
That was not the best way and not accurate but it worked somehow. Later, i found another way to overcome this problem. I simply run the key recording scripts on the pi and created the dataset on the pi instead of creating it on the pc.
Although the name says 'recording key press over video', it doesnt do that. It takes current image data captured by the camera mounted on the raspberry and when you press a key it combines them in a numpy file.
