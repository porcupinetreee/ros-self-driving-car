## ros-self-driving-car
This project implemented on a 4 wheel raspberry pi car. Using Robot Operating System, I provided communication between sensors ( camera ) and machines ( pi, pc) over a wireless network. In the future, I am going to add different sensors like motor encoders, proximity sensors etc... For now, it is what it is.

# PC Environment:
